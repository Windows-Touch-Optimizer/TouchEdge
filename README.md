# TouchEdge
Bring Touch Bar to Windows!


## What's this?

This is a Windows application. The goal of this project is to provide a Touch Bar like experience for Windows tablet users.

This application will show a toolbar window at the left of right edge of the screen. That's why I named this project as Touch Edge. Below is a very rough design drawn in Windows Paint.

## Why?

Touch experience on Windows tablet is awful. I thought about many ways to make it better and find the answer is Touch Bar. Touch Bar is abondoned by Apple, but I think the reason is not that this feature is bad.

Mac has a keyboard and keyboard is more efficient than Touch Bar, so keyboard users don't need a touch bar. But Windows tablet can be used without keyboard and applications on Windows are all designed for laptop or desktop like Mac applications, Touch Bar is a good choice in this case.


## Status of this project

Only an idea, but I will build a demo as soon as posibile.
